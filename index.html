<p>I am currently a President's Postdoctoral Fellow in the Psychology department at the 
  University of Maryland.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, I am interested in what speech and prosody — the rhythm, 
  intonation, and intensity of speech — reveal about the cognitive mechanisms 
  that underlie language production, comprehension, and acquisition. An ongoing goal of mine has been to
  develop computational models of language production and comprehension.</p>

<p>My latest research focuses on how listeners integrate information from a variety of cues, 
  and on how people learn to understand and produce constructions that are not already familiar to them 
  (e.g., new uses of prosody, pronunciations that are not native to their language, etc.).</p>

<p>Some of my past research has explored what durational changes reveal about the mechanisms 
  that underlie language production, how communicative context affects how 
  speakers use prosody, and how listeners use information from other levels of 
  language to parse prosodic structure.</p>

<p>Before arriving at Maryland, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Brain and Cognitive Sciences 
  Department at the University of Rochester. I got my PhD in Psychology at the University 
  of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, working in collaboration with <a href="http://www.duanegwatson.com/">Dr. Duane Watson</a>.  
  Before that, I got my BA in Psychology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel 
  Hill, where I worked with <a href="https://jenniferarnold.web.unc.edu/">Dr. Jennifer Arnold</a>.</p>
