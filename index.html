I am currently a postdoc in the Brain and Cognitive Sciences department at the 
University of Rochester. I work in collaboration with [Dr. Chigusa Kurumada](https://www.chigusakurumada.com/)
and [Dr. Florian Jaeger](https://www.hlp.rochester.edu/people/).

Broadly speaking, my research studies speech and prosody — the rhythm, 
intonation, and intensity of speech — as a way to explore the cognitive mechanisms 
that underlie language production, comprehension, and acquisition. 

My current research focuses on whether and how people learn to understand and 
produce constructions that are not already familiar to them (e.g., new uses of 
prosody, pronunciations that are not native to their language, etc.).

Some of my past research explores what prosody reveals about the mechanisms 
that underlie language production, how communicational context affects how 
speakers use prosody, and how listeners use information from other levels of 
language to parse prosodic structure.  

Before arriving at Rochester, I got my PhD in Cognitive Psychology at the University 
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, working in collaboration with [Dr. Duane Watson](https://www.duanegwatson.com/).  
Before that, I got my BA in Psychology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel 
Hill, where I worked with [Dr. Jennifer Arnold](https://jenniferarnold.web.unc.edu/).
